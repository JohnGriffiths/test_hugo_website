entirely used yet, and require ecologists to get curious about tools and
practices from the field of data science. We explore applications of machine
learning and deep learning to biodiversity.</p><p>We are working on understanding the type of problems that we can solve without
having to do new sampling, and how to handle errors and uncertainty.</p><p>As a bonus, we use the tools we develop to improve the monitoring and reporting
abilities of various stakeholders. One of our key question related to this topic
at the moment is to examine the &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; of existing data to address a
given question. We work on measures to identify areas in which information is
low, which should be sampled with a higher priority.</p><p>Addressing new questions often requires to develop new tools. We develop
statistical and mathematical approaches, implement them, and release them as
free and open-source software to make analyses reproducible and reliable. A lot
of our work uses <a href=https://julialang.org/>Julia</a>, a high-performance language
for numerical computing. We are developing a few of our own packages, and
contribute to the <a href=https://github.com/EcoJulia/>EcoJulia</a> project on GitHub.</p><p>We lead the development of the <a href=http://mangal.io>mangal.io</a> project, an open
database of species interactions and associated packages. We think a lot about
what the best practices for scientific software should be, and do a lot of
training. We sincerely believe that good science requires good tools, and we
want to help everyone build and use them.</p></section></main><footer><section class=container>We are located in the <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/qtGaMPy9g8jXZz9AA target=_blank>Campus MIL</a> of <a href=http://umontreal.ca target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Université de Montréal</a>.<br>We are mainly funded by <a href=https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp target=_blank>NSERC</a>, <a href=http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/accueil target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">FRQNT</a>, <a href=https://www.innovation.ca/fr target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">CFI</a>, <a href=https://ivado.ca/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">IVADO</a>, and <a href=https://wellcome.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Wellcome</a>.<br>Contact Timothée Poisot by <a href=mailto:timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca>email</a> (or don't).</section></footer></body></html>
