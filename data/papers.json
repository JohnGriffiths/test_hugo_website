Apart from preempting infectious disease events, there is considerable interest in determining why certain pathogens are consistently found in some regions, and why others spontaneously emerge or re-emerge over time. Here, we use a trait-free approach which leverages information on the global community of human infectious diseases to estimate the potential for pathogen outbreak, emergence, and re-emergence events over time. Our approach uses pairwise dissimilarities among pathogen distributions between countries and country-level pathogen composition to quantify pathogen outbreak, emergence, and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g., number of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g., virus), and transmission mode (e.g., vector-borne). We find that while outbreak and re-emergence potential are well captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events remains elusive, and sudden global emergences like an influenza pandemic seem beyond the predictive capacity of the model. While our approach allows for dynamic predictability of outbreak and re-emergence events, data deficiencies and the stochastic nature of emergence events may preclude accurate prediction; but our results make a compelling case for incorporating a community ecology perspective into existing disease forecasting efforts.","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/31/336065","DOI":"10.1101/336065","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Dallas","given":"Tad A."},{"family":"Carlson","given":"Colin J."},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothee"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,31]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,6,1]]}},

That said, extant ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters and local effects. It is therefore unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host–parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.03788","DOI":"10.1111/oik.03788","ISSN":"1600-0706","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,5,3]]}},

Respondents thought that 30% of classes in ecology-related degrees should be focused on quantitative disciplines, which is likely higher than for most existing programs.

Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species’ phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species’ interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species’ interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3644","DOI":"10.7717/peerj.3644","author":[{"family":"Desjardins-Proulx","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Laigle","given":"Idaline"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]}},

Science is traditionally founded on theories and models, most often formalized with mathematical formulas handcrafted by theoretical scientists and refined through experiments. Machine learning, an important branch of modern Artificial Intelligence, focuses on learning from data. This leads to a fundamentally different approach to model-building: we step back and focus on the design of algorithms capable of building models from data, but the models themselves are not designed by humans. This is even more true with deep learning, which requires little engineering by hand and is responsible for many of Artificial Intelligence's spectacular successes. In contrast to logic systems, knowledge from a deep learning model is difficult to understand, reuse, and may involve up to a billion parameters. On the other hand, probabilistic machine learning techniques such as deep learning offer an opportunity to tackle large complex problems that are out of the reach of traditional theory-making. It is possible that the more intuition-like reasoning performed by deep learning systems is mostly incompatible with the logic formalism of mathematics. Yet recent studies have shown that deep learning can be useful to logic systems and vice versa. Success at unifying different paradigms of Artificial Intelligence from logic to probability theory offers unique opportunities to combine data-driven approaches with traditional theories. These advancements are susceptible to impact significantly biological sciences, where dimensionality is high and limit the investigation of traditional theories.","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/10/22/161125","DOI":"10.1101/161125","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Desjardins-Proulx","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,22]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2017,11,3]]}},

Ecological networks of interacting species may adhere to a similar pattern of decreasing interaction similarity with increasing geographic distance, especially if species interactions are maintained across space. We extend this further, examining if host-parasite networks – independent of host and parasite species identities – become more structurally dissimilar with increasing geographic distance. Utilizing a global database of helminth parasite occurrence records, we find evidence for distance-decay relationships in host and parasite communities at both regional and global scales, but fail to detect similar relationships in network structural similarity. Host and parasite community similarity were strongly related, and both decayed rapidly with increasing geographic distance, typically resulting in complete dissimilarity after approximately 2500 km. Our failure to detect a decay in network structural similarity suggests the possibility that different host and parasite species are filling the same functional roles in interaction networks, or that variation in network similarity may be better explained by other geographic variables or aspects of host and parasite ecology.

Yet its status as a unifying concept is not always appreciated because of its similarity to concepts of the niche, the many levels of biological phenomena to which it applies, and the complexity of the mechanisms influencing it. The evolution of specialisation requires the coupling of constraints on adaptive evolution with covariation of genotype and environmental performance. This covariation itself depends upon organismal properties such as dispersal behaviour and life history and complexity in the environment stemming from factors such as species interactions and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in resources. Here, we develop a view on specialisation that integrates across the range of biological phenomena with the goal of developing a more predictive conceptual framework that specifically accounts for the importance of biotic complexity and coevolutionary events.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01645.x/full","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01645.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Bever","given":"James D."},{"family":"Nemri","given":"Adnane"},{"family":"Thrall","given":"Peter H."},{"family":"Hochberg","given":"Michael E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,2]]},"container-title-short":"Ecol.

Studies suggest that the initial evolution of protective mutualists might involve closely related pathogenic variants with similar life histories, but different competitive abilities and impacts on host fitness. We derive a model to evaluate this hypothesis and show that, in general, a protective variant cannot spread from rarity or exclude a more pathogenic strain. While the conditions allowing mutualist invasion are more likely with increased environmental productivity, they still depend on initial densities in the invaded patch exceeding a threshold, highlighting the likely importance of spatial structure and demographic stochasticity. Using a numerical simulation approach, we show that regional coexistence is in fact possible in an explicitly spatial system and that, under some circumstances, the mutualist population can exclude the enemy. More broadly, the establishment of protective mutualists may be favored when there are other life-history differences from more pathogenic symbionts, such as vertical transmission or additional direct benefits to hosts.","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.1151","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Bever","given":"James D."},{"family":"Thrall","given":"Peter H."},{"family":"Hochberg","given":"Michael E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,10]]},"PMID":"25614798","PMCID":"PMC4301050","container-title-short":"Ecol Evol"},

To date, however, social network analysis of wild populations has been limited to static models that cannot precisely reflect the dynamics of learning, for instance, the impact of multiple observations across time. Here, we present a novel dynamic version of network analysis that is capable of capturing temporal aspects of acquisition--that is, how successive observations by an individual influence its acquisition of the novel behavior. We apply this model to studying the spread of two novel tool-use variants, \"moss-sponging\" and \"leaf-sponge re-use,\" in the Sonso chimpanzee community of Budongo Forest, Uganda. Chimpanzees are widely considered the most \"cultural\" of all animal species, with 39 behaviors suspected as socially acquired, most of them in the domain of tool-use. The cultural hypothesis is supported by experimental data from captive chimpanzees and a range of observational data. However, for wild groups, there is still no direct experimental evidence for social learning, nor has there been any direct observation of social diffusion of behavioral innovations. Here, we tested both a static and a dynamic network model and found strong evidence that diffusion patterns of moss-sponging, but not leaf-sponge re-use, were significantly better explained by social than individual learning. The most conservative estimate of social transmission accounted for 85% of observed events, with an estimated 15-fold increase in learning rate for each time a novice observed an informed individual moss-sponging. We conclude that group-specific behavioral variants in wild chimpanzees can be socially learned, adding to the evidence that this prerequisite for culture originated in a common ancestor of great apes and humans, long before the advent of modern humans.","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pbio.1001960","ISSN":"1545-7885","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Hobaiter","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Zuberbühler","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Hoppitt","given":"William"},{"family":"Gruber","given":"Thibaud"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,9]]},"PMID":"25268798","PMCID":"PMC4181963","container-title-short":"PLoS Biol."},

Although experimental tests of theory from a range of biological systems are largely concordant regarding the influence of several driving processes, we know little as to how mechanisms acting at the smallest scales (individual molecular and phenotypic changes) may result in the emergence of structures at larger scales, such as coevolutionary dynamics and local adaptation. We capitalized on methods commonly employed in community ecology to quantify how the structure of community interaction matrices, so called ‘bipartite networks’, reflected observed coevolutionary dynamics, and how phages from these communities may or may not have adapted locally to their bacterial hosts. We found a consistent nested network structure for two phage types, one previously demonstrated to exhibit arms race coevolutionary dynamics and the other fluctuating coevolutionary dynamics. Both phages increased their host ranges through evolutionary time, but we found no evidence for a trade off with impact on bacteria. Finally, only bacteria from the arms race phage showed local adaptation, and we provide preliminary evidence that these bacteria underwent (sometimes different) molecular changes in the wzy gene associated with the LPS receptor, while bacteria coevolving with the fluctuating selection phage did not show local adaptation and had partial deletions of the pilF gene associated with Type IV pili. We conclude that the structure of phage-bacteria interaction networks is not necessarily specific to coevolutionary dynamics, and discuss hypotheses for why only one of the two phages was, nevertheless, locally adapted.

James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship.

Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested and are hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals.

Using an updated phylogeny of this genus, we show that molecular and morphological evolution are weakly correlated, and that most of the morphologically defined taxonomical units are not consistent with the molecular data. We suggest that Lamellodiscus morphology is probably constrained by strong environmental (host-induced) pressure, and discuss why this result can apply to other taxa. Genetic variability within nuclear 18S and mitochondrial COI genes are compared for several monogenean genera, as this measure may reflect the level of diversification within a genus. Overall our results suggest that cryptic speciation events may occur within Lamellodiscus, and discuss the links between morphological and molecular evolution.","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0026252","ISSN":"1932-6203","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Verneau","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Desdevises","given":"Yves"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"PMID":"22022582","PMCID":"PMC3192175","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE"},

Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12118/full","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12118","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Mouquet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,2]]},"container-title-short":"Ecol.

Although theoretical studies indicate that restricted conditions may be necessary to achieve co-occurrence of specialists and generalists, analyses of larger empirical (and species-rich) communities reveal the pervasiveness of coexistence. In this paper, we analyze 175 ecological bipartite networks of three interaction types (animal hosts-parasite, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator), and measure the extent to which these communities are composed of species with different levels of specificity in their biotic interactions. We find a continuum from specialism to generalism.

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions.

Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages.

However, these analyses may be sensitive to sampling biases in both the interactors (the nodes of the network) and interactions (the links between nodes). These issues may affect the accuracy of empirically constructed ecological networks. We explore the properties of sampled ecological networks by simulating large-scale ecological networks with predetermined topologies, and sampling them with different mathematical procedures. Several types of modular networks were generated, intended to represent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and types of ecological interactions. We sampled these networks with different sampling designs that may be encountered in field experiments. The observed networks generated by each sampling process were analyzed with respect to number and size of components. We show that the sampling effort needed to estimate underlying network properties depends both on the sampling design and on network topology. Networks with random or scale-free modules require more complete sampling compared to networks whose modules are nested or bipartite. Overall, the structure of nested modules was the easiest to detect, regardless of sampling design. Sampling according to species degree was consistently found to be the most accurate strategy to estimate network structure. Conversely, sampling according to module results in an accurate view of certain modules, but fails to provide a global picture of the underlying network. We recommend that these findings are incorporated into the design of projects aiming to characterize large networks of species interactions in the field, to reduce sampling biases. The software scripts developed to construct and sample networks are provided for further explorations of network structure and comparisons to real interaction data.","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01242","author":[{"family":"Aguiar","given":"Marcus A.

These are embedded in a diverse network of trophic interactions, resulting in a cascade of events following perturbations such as species extinction. The sheer scale of oceans, however, precludes the characterization of marine feeding networks through de novo sampling. This effort ought instead to rely on a combination of extensive data and inference. Here we investigate how the distribution of trophic interactions at the global scale shapes the marine fish food web structure. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous distribution of species ranges in biogeographic regions should concentrate interactions in the warmest areas and within species groups. We find that the inferred global metaweb of marine fish—that is, all possible potential feeding links between co-occurring species—is highly connected geographically with a low degree of spatial modularity. Metrics of network structure correlate with sea surface temperature and tend to peak towards the tropics. In contrast to open-water communities, coastal food webs have greater interaction redundancy, which may confer robustness to species extinction. Our results suggest that marine ecosystems are connected yet display some resistance to perturbations because of high robustness at most locations.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-019-0950-y","DOI":"10.1038/s41559-019-0950-y","ISSN":"2397-334X","author":[{"family":"Albouy","given":"Camille"},{"family":"Archambault","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Appeltans","given":"Ward"},{"family":"Araújo","given":"Miguel B."},{"family":"Beauchesne","given":"David"},{"family":"Cazelles","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Cirtwill","given":"Alyssa R."},{"family":"Fortin","given":"Marie-Josée"},{"family":"Galiana","given":"Nuria"},{"family":"Leroux","given":"Shawn J."},{"family":"Pellissier","given":"Loïc"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Spencer A."},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,1]]},"container-title-short":"Nature Ecology & Evolution"},

However, the accurate description of food webs requires significant effort in time and resources, limiting their widespread use in ecological studies. Newly published methods allow for the inference of feeding interactions using proxy variables. Here, we compare the accuracy of two recently described methods, as well as describe a composite model of the two, for the inference of feeding interactions using a large, well-described dataset. 2.Both niche and neutral processes are involved in determining whether or not two species will form a feeding link in communities. Three different models for determining niche constraints of feeding interactions are compared, and all three models are extended by incorporating neutral processes, based on relative abundances. The three models compared here infer niche processes through 1) phylogenetic relationships, 2) local species trait distributions (e.g. body size), and 3) a composite of phylogeny and local traits. 3.We show that all three methods perform well at predicting individual species interactions, and that these individual predictions scale up to the network level, resulting in food-web structure of inferred networks being similar to their empirical counterparts. 4.Our results indicate that inferring food-web structure using phylogenies can be an efficient way of getting summary webs with minimal data, and offers a conservative test of changes in food-web structure, particularly when there is low species turnover between sites. Inferences made using traits requires more data, but allows for greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying trophic interactions. A composite model of the two methods provides a framework for investigating the importance of how phylogeny, trait distributions, and relative abundances, affect species interactions, and network structure.

Biotic homogenization in species composition (i.e., increased site-to-site similarity) is recognized as a common consequence of global change, but less is known about how the similarity of species relationships changes over space and time. Does homogenization of species composition lead to homogenization of species relationships or are the dynamics of species relationships decoupled from changes in species composition? Location Wisconsin, USA. Time period 1950–2012. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We used long-term resurvey data to analyse changes in plant species association patterns between the 1950s and 2000s at 266 sites distributed among three community types in Wisconsin, USA. We used species associations (quantified via local co-occurrence patterns) to represent one type of relationship among species. Species pairs that co-occur more or less than expected by chance have positive or negative associations, respectively. We then measured beta diversity in both species composition and species association networks over time and space. Results Shifts in species associations consistently exceeded the shifts observed in species composition. Less disturbed forests of northern Wisconsin have converged somewhat in species composition but little in species associations. In contrast, forests in central Wisconsin succeeding from pine barrens to closed-canopy forests have strongly homogenized in both species composition and species associations. More fragmented forests in southern Wisconsin also tended to converge in species composition and in the species' negative associations, but their positive associations diverged over the last half century. Species composition and associations are generally affected by a similar set of environmental variables. Their relative importance, however, has changed over time.

Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but only recently community ecologists realized the need to document their spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time – i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modeling. We apply this framework to host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modeling and community ecology.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ecog.04006","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.04006","ISSN":"1600-0587","title-short":"Bringing Elton and Grinnell together","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Baiser","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Dunne","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Kopelke","given":"Jens-Peter"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Neo D."},{"family":"Nyman","given":"Tommi"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Tylianakis","given":"Jason M."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Spencer A."},{"family":"Roslin","given":"Tomas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,4]]}},

Collections of well-studied food webs and replicate food webs from the same system that span biogeographical and ecological gradients now enable detailed, quantitative investigation of such questions and help integrate food web ecology and macroecology. Here, we integrate macroecology and food web ecology by focusing on how ecogeographical rules [the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Rapoport's rule] are associated with the architecture of food webs. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied All taxa. Methods We discuss the implications of each ecogeographical rule for food webs, present predictions for how food web structure will vary with each rule, assess empirical support where available, and discuss how food webs may influence ecogeographical rules. Finally, we recommend systems and approaches for further advancing this research agenda. Results We derived testable predictions for some ecogeographical rules (e.g. LDG, Rapoport's rule), while for others (e.g., Bergmann's and island rules) it is less clear how we would expect food webs to change over macroecological scales. Based on the LDG, we found weak support for both positive and negative relationships between food chain length and latitude and for increased generality and linkage density at higher latitudes. Based on Rapoport's rule, we found support for the prediction that species turnover in food webs is inversely related to latitude. Main conclusions The macroecology of food webs goes beyond traditional approaches to biodiversity at macroecological scales by focusing on trophic interactions among species. The collection of food web data for different types of ecosystems across biogeographical gradients is key to advance this research agenda. Further, considering food web interactions as a selection pressure that drives or disrupts ecogeographical rules has the potential to address both mechanisms of and deviations from these macroecological relationships. For these reasons, further integration of macroecology and food webs will help ecologists better understand the assembly, maintenance and change of ecosystems across space and time.","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12925","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12925","ISSN":"1466-8238","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Baiser","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Cirtwill","given":"Alyssa R."},{"family":"Dunne","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Fahimipour","given":"Ashkaan K."},{"family":"Gilarranz","given":"Luis J."},{"family":"Grochow","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Li","given":"Daijiang"},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Neo D."},{"family":"McGrew","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Romanuk","given":"Tamara N."},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Trotta","given":"Lauren B."},{"family":"Valdovinos","given":"Fernanda S."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Spencer A."},{"family":"Yeakel","given":"Justin D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,21]]}},
