# Fully funded positions

All of these positions are part of a seven years program on using modern
artificial intelligence techniques to develop a unified knowledge base for
ecology and evolution; this build on previous research on [AI for automated
ecological synthesis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/161125v4)
(*read it before applying*). In addition, please read the lab's [values and
philosophy](https://poisotlab.io/values/) before applying.

> The project in a nutshell: with recent advances in artificial intelligence,
bridging probability theory and logic theory, we have a chance to (i)
formalize our knowledge about ecological systems in quantified statements,
(ii) embed these statements in a densely connected knowledge graph that will
draw links between distant sub-fields, and (iii) use existing open data to
validate and weigh the veracity of these statements. If successful, this
will lead to a rich knowledge representation that might reveal **there are,
after all, general laws in ecology**. The research axes identified for this
effort will focus on (i) public health concerns related to disease emergence
and re-emergence, and (ii) changes in species distributions under climate
change and the subsequent re-wiring of species interaction networks.

All positions are fully funded, and come with yearly support for travel to
workshops and conferences, open access publication, and computer equipment. All
positions also come with free access to [Compute
Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) infrastructure, including a GPU cluster,
and training sessions on advanced research computing.

Fellows selected as part of this project will also be involved in organizing and
TA-ing two intensive classes on artificial intelligence for biodiversity
science, and one symposium on the same topic followed by a two-days writing
retreat (all activities are fully funded). All applicants will get the
opportunity to mentor undergraduate research assistants as well as graduate
students from our MSc in Quantitative and Computational Biology.

This research program is by nature pluri-disciplinary. Candidates with only a
subset of the preferred qualifications are encouraged to apply. All applicants
are expected to have a robust foundation in either applied mathematics or
scientific programming, and an interest for biodiversity, or a robust foundation
in biodiversity and an interest for mathematics and programming. At no points
will *grades* or *journal impact factors* be considered as a measure of the
quality of an applicant.

Please email the application materials *in a single PDF file* (named
`lastname.pdf`) to `timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca`, with the subject "General
laws: name of the position". Review of applications will start immediately, and
applicants will be interviewed on a rolling basis unless the positions are
filled. Applicants, especially for the PhD fellowships, who do not have
published articles, can instead write a short summary of the most exciting
research project.

All positions will be at the Department of Biological Sciences, Université de
Montréal.
