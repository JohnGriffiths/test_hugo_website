title: Join us!

We currently have one opening at the post-doctoral level (two years), to work on
the coupling between biodiversity and ecosystem models in order to develop a
flexible, modular simulation toolkit to assist stakeholder-engaged design of
biodiversity monitoring networks. In collaboration with an already active
post-doctoral fellow, the aim of this project is coupling models of biodiversity
status and ecosystem trends, by **developing a biomonitoring optimization
program that can recommend locations to monitor ecosystem status**, within a
biological region of interest, that are optimal now and under climate change
scenarios, in order to capture relevant changes in biodiversity.

By working closely with the [GEO BON](https://geobon.org/) secretariat, as well
as the nascent Québec-BON, will **support the development of a methodology to
provide information on the optimal Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) and
Ecosystem Function Indicators (EFI) to monitor in order to make sound policy
recommendations**.

Ultimately, this project will result in an **assessment of the feasibility of
multi-purpose spatial networks of locations that can inform on statuses and
trends for biodiversity**, with extensions to zoonotic diseases, showing how the
methodology of ecosystem sciences translates to ecosystem conservation and
global health.

A large part of the project will consist on expanding an ecosystem of packages,
hosted and maintained by the [EcoJulia](https://github.com/EcoJulia)
organisation; the overall flow of information is presented in this figure:

Existing data (grey boxes to the left) will flow through existing codebases for ecosystem structure (EcoSISTEM.jl), community structure (Diversity.jl, Phylo.jl, EcologicalNetworks.jl), climatic data (SimpleSDMLayers.jl, SpatialDataSources.jl), and biological dynamics (BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl), which will then be coupled to create new simulation models. This task will form the bulk of the work of post-doctoral fellow 1. The output of these simulations will serve to develop BioSurveillance.jl (led by post-doctoral fellow 2), which will be used, through interactions with stakeholders, to simulate multi-purpose monitoring networks, and validate them through case studies in biodiversity and disease dynamics at several spatial (100s to 1000s km²) and temporal (extant to 100 years horizon) scales. The case studies will be carried out by graduate students already working on spatial biodiversity monitoring and spatially explicit disease surveillance, and will serve as a unique opportunity to put these tools to use in a variety of situations, and with a variety of collaborators and stakeholders.](files/wellcome_conceptual_figure.png)

## Details on the position

The position will be hosted at the Université de Montréal, and comes with yearly
travel money, and a lump sum for computer equipment (one laptop and two
monitors).

Post-doctoral researchers at Université de Montréal are part of a union, which
guarantees a yearly salary between 35k and 58k CAD (and benefits). Owing to the
strategic nature of this project, the yearly salary for this position will
*start* at the highest allowed amount, with extensions up to approx. 63000 CAD
annually, and as an incitative mechanism for candidates from under-represented
minorities in STEM. The salary includes a 3% guaranteed annual increase.

Desired qualifications for the position are listed below. *Desired*
qualifications means that it would be nice for the applicant to have them, but
they can be picked up rapidly by a motivated scientist. *Required*
qualifications listed after them will be used to triage applications --
applicants who do not possess these qualifications will not be considered.

The desired qualifications, listed in no specific order, are:

- development, maintenance, or significant contributions to software packages,
  showing good practices in software engineering
- experience in writing documentation and vignettes for packages or code
- contribution to a "Software Note" or "Application" article
- experience in using distributed computing systems (CPU and/or GPU)
- expertise in using a version control system (`git` in particular, knowledge of
  *GitHub actions* strongly appreciated)
- knowledge of the *Julia* programming language, or strong willingness to learn 
- work with stakeholders, notably through participation in facilitated or
  stakeholder-engaged workshops or projects
- global understanding of contemporary issues in biodiversity governance
- experience in tropical or temperate ecosystems ecology
- a commitment to open science as a practice -- because we recognize that not
  everyone can safely contribute to open science, this will be assessed both by
  looking at realizations, or by the narrative in the letter of presentation

## Summary of the position and required qualifications

The position is a **two years** appointment, starting as early as September
2022. Because post-doctoral positions are limited to 5 years post-*Ph.D.*,
applicants who are less than three years post-*Ph.D.* will have an advantage,
and we are specifically aiming to hire a *junior* post-doc (*i.e.* immediately
after *Ph.D.*).

Required qualifications:

- strong skills in spatial statistics, and notably Bayesian spatial statistics
  *or* strong quantitative/statistical background in landscape ecology
- *Ph.D.* in ecology *or* epidemiology, *or* in statistics applied to either
  fields, which does not have to be completed at the time of application

Core project milestones:

- development of a statistical approach to optimize the location of sampling
  sites in a monitoring network, allowing it to maintain its efficiency under
  current and projected climate scenarios (year 1)
- implementation of this approach in the existing codebase of the
  `BiodiversityObservationNetworks.jl` software package, automating the
  collection of climate data and presenting different network proposals (year
  1,2)
- production of a case study including empirical monitoring data (year 2)

## How to apply

Applications should be send by email directly to `timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca`,
with the subject line "Ecosystems post-doc 2: NAME". Applications will be
reviewed starting immediately and continue until the positions are filled.

The application should contain a two-pages letter of presentation
(`name-letter.pdf`) containing a brief overview of past research, a description
of how you meet the required and desired qualifications, and a statement of
interest for the position and the project. The application should also contain a
*short* resume (`name-resume.pdf`; no more than three pages), focusing on
professional accomplishments (grades and funding history, as they are strongly
biased against under-represented minorities, will not be evaluated, and do not
need to be mentioned).

The interview process involves three steps that are typically completed within
two weeks: a one-hour discussion with Timothée to talk about qualifications and
motivation; a discussion with self-nominated current and former group members,
to get a sense of what life is like in the lab, the department, the university,
etc.; finally, a discussion to go through the logistics and to prepare the
offer.
