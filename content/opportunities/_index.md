# Postdoctoral Teaching and Research Fellow

This position is open as part of the *Living Data Project for ecology, evolution
and environmental science*

We seek a full-time postdoctoral teaching and research fellow to join the Living
Data Project at McGill University and the Université de Montréal. The Living
Data Project is a national initiative including 6 Canadian universities, led by
the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution (CIEE), to (1) preserve - using
best practices in digital archiving and data management - legacy datasets in
ecology, evolution and environmental science; (2) synthesize scientific data and
concepts using collaborative team approaches; and (3) provide training for
graduate students and other early-career researchers in data management,
reproducible research, synthesis statistics and scientific collaboration.

The successful candidate will be responsible for:

- Training and mentorship of graduate and undergraduate students involved in the Living Data Project (LDP),

- Assisting in the organization of data rescue internships with academic and non-academic researchers,

- Organizing, in collaboration with LDP postdoctoral fellows located at other Canadian universities, multi-institutional training events such as workshops and working groups.

The postdoctoral fellow will be provided with opportunities to be involved in
research through the working groups and other collaborations with Living Data
Project members. The postdoctoral fellow will be mentored in this project by
university faculty in both institutions (Prof. Pollock & Sunday, McGill; Prof.
Poisot & Harvey, UdeM), will be eligible to become a member of the Québec Centre
for Biodiversity Sciences, and will receive logistical and administrative
assistance from the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution (CIEE).

We seek a highly qualified individual with a Ph.D. in any area of ecology,
evolution or environmental science who has demonstrated exceptional skills in
data management, quantitative analysis (not limited to frequentist statistics,
i.e. including machine learning), and scientific collaboration. Priority will be
given to candidates who have proficiencies in at least some of the following
skills: data archiving, programming, version control (e.g. GitHub), reproducible
research, database construction, collation of large databases from multiple
sources, citizen science, advanced statistics and quantitative techniques (e.g.
hierarchical modelling, structural equation models, meta-analysis), and
collaborating in working groups. We particularly encourage candidates with prior
experience in teaching or mentoring of the above skills, either as a teaching
assistant, instructor of record, or in any other capacity. Candidates should
also have excellent organizational, interpersonal, and communication skills;
fluency in spoken and written English; and a strong personal commitment to
research, teaching, and the values of open and reproducible science.
Conversational French is a plus but not required for the position.

The initial appointment is for seven months, renewable for up to 2 years. The
successful candidate will have access to office space and professional
development opportunities both at McGill and UdeM for the duration of the
contract but will be on McGill University payroll.

Applicants should submit a CV, statement of relevant experience and training,
and short (300 words) statements on EDI and Open Science, as well as the names
and contact information (including phone and e-mail) of up to three references
to Laura Pollock (`laura.pollock@mcgill.ca`) and Timothée Poisot
(`timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca`), with the subject line “LivingData post-doc”.
Undergraduate transcripts are not relevant information for this position and
must neither be included nor mentioned. Pre-prints that are publicly available
are acceptable evidence of scholarship and we encourage applicants to mention
them in their application; similarly, owing to the nature of the project,
publicly deposited datasets and software should similarly be discussed.

Review of applications will begin immediately and will remain open until filled,
with the appointment anticipated to begin no later than September 1, 2020.
Although the project will start remotely, we expect the successful candidate to
be based in Montréal. The successful applicant will receive a salary of $50,000
per year plus benefits. The position is subject to final budgetary approval

We encourage all qualified persons to apply; however, Canadians and Permanent
Residents of Canada will be given priority. Equity and diversity are essential
to academic excellence. An open and diverse community fosters the inclusion of
voices that have been underrepresented or discouraged. We encourage applications
from members of groups that have been marginalized on any grounds, including
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, racialization,
disability, political belief, religion, marital or family status, age, and/or
status as a First Nation, Metis, Inuit, or Indigenous person.

# Ph.D. fellow in artificial intelligence applied to ecology

We are seeking one Ph.D. fellow interested in applications of machine learning
and artificial intelligence to biodiversity monitoring. The position is fully
funded, and come with yearly support for travel to workshops and conferences,
open access publication, and computer equipmentas well as free access to
[Compute Canada](https://www.computecanada.ca/) infrastructure, including a GPU
cluster, and training sessions on advanced research computing.

Topics of particular interest are: image processing, species distribution
models, probabilistic programming, landscape connectivity, epidemiology,
time-series analyses, and the inference of ecological networks. The appointment
is for a 4 years period, and is expected to start in the fall of 2020.

The successful candidate will be involved in organizing and TA-ing two intensive
classes on artificial intelligence and deep learning for biodiversity science,
and one symposium on the same topic followed by a two-days writing retreat (all
activities are fully funded). The applicant will get the opportunity to mentor
undergraduate research assistants as well as graduate students from our MSc in
Quantitative and Computational Biology.

This research project is by nature pluri-disciplinary. Candidates with only a
subset of the preferred qualifications are encouraged to apply. All applicants
are expected to have a robust foundation in applied mathematics and scientific
programming, and an interest for biodiversity. At no points will *grades* or
*journal impact factors* be considered as a measure of the quality of an
applicant.

Please email the application materials *in a single PDF file* (named
`lastname.pdf`) to `timothee.poisot@umontreal.ca`, with the subject "PhD
application - biodiversity/AI". Review of applications will start immediately,
and applicants will be interviewed on a rolling basis unless the positions are
filled. Applicants who do not have published articles, can instead write a short
summary of the most exciting research project.

All positions will be at the Department of Biological Sciences, Université de
Montréal.

Applications material must include:

1. A letter of presentation (up to 1200 words), outlining past research achievements, future research plans, and any relevant information
1. A statement on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusiveness in academia, of up to 400 words
1. A statement on Open Science of up to 400 words, if possible including quantified or qualified statements about previous or ongoing open practices, or a statement of open philosophy for applicants who have not received the opportunity of working openly
1. A copy of the most representative publication (preprints accepted), alongside a 300 words explanation of why it is *exciting*
1. Name and email for up to three references, which will be contacted after a short interview
