**We use thinking-boxes and a lot of numbers to learn about where animals and green things live, and what they eat.**

We use mathematical and computational tools to address questions in community
ecology and biogeography, with a particular focus on the structure of ecological
networks and species interactions. Our interests include simulations, data
analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and as little field work as possible.
We believe in open science, in ecological synthesis based on open data, and in
actionable fundamental research.
