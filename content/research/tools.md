Addressing these new questions often requires to develop new tools. We develop
statistical and mathematical approaches, implement them, and release them as
free and open source software to make network analysis user-friendly.

We also contribute to the [mangal.io](http://mangal.io) project, an open
database of species interactions and associated packages. We think a lot about
what the best practices for scientific software should be, and do a lot of
training. We sincerely believe that good science requires good tools, and we
want to help everyone build and use them.
