Can we use ecological information to make predictions about emerging viral
pathogens? We work within the [VERENA](http://viralemergence.org/) consortium to
build models that help assess the emergence risk of various viruses, based on
species distribution modeling and biotic interaction inference.

This research provides a challenging opportunity to apply methods from
fundamental computational ecology into a new area. By collaborating with disease
ecologists, public health scientists, and virologists, we can give these tools a
new life!
