# Predictive approaches of network structure

Can we predict inter-specific interactions? We are interested in developing
predictive models that would use different sources of information (functional
traits, local abundances, previous knowledge, ...) to predict the probability
that two species will interact. These models are required to forecast the
structure of novel communities that will emerge through global changes. They
also require to develop new tools to merge data, and improved statistical
models to fill in the gaps between the different datasets.

# Numerical toolkits for network analysis

Addressing these new questions often requires to develop new tools. We develop
statistical and mathematical approaches, implement them, and release them as
free and open source software to make network analysis user-friendly. We
also contribute to the [mangal.io](http://mangal.io) project, an open
database of species interactions and associated packages. We think a lot
about what the best practices for scientific software should be, and do a
lot of training. We sincerely believe that good science requires good tools,
and we want to help everyone build and use them.
