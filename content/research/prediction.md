Can we predict inter-specific interactions? We are interested in developing
predictive models that would use different sources of information (functional
traits, local abundances, previous knowledge, ...) to predict the probability
that two species will interact.

These models are required to forecast the
structure of novel communities that will emerge through global changes. They
also require to develop new tools to merge data, and improved statistical
models to fill in the gaps between the different datasets.
