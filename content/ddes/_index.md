We are organizing the fifth edition of our intensive class in data-driven
ecological synthesis, with support from the NSERC BIOS² CREATE program. You can
[apply on-line][form], or read the description below. Enrolment is limited to 30
students. The class will run from in the first week of May 2020, at the
Laurentians Field Station, just outside of Montréal.

# Goals and target audience

This week-long intensive class will give early-career ecologists the tools and
skills needed to interact with, manage, clean, and analyze data in a transparent
and reproducible way. We will specifically work on leveraging open data to
address new ecological questions at large spatial and temporal scales. You can
read more about the approach of computational ecology in [a paper][paper]
co-authored by students from the 2017 cohort.

**We expect that the attendees are able to turn the computer on, or willing to
learn how to do so. We will take care of the rest from here**. A passing
knowledge of statistics and programming is a good thing, but eagerness
to learn is **far** more important than previous knowledge.

The class is open to all, and previous attendees included undergraduate and
graduate students, staff scientists, data analysts, and post-doctoral fellows.
We think it is particularly relevant for *PhD* students and post-doctoral
fellows.

Over the course of seven days, including learners-led projects that can be
continued after the class, we will cover:

- good practices for data management
- good practices in scientific computing
- good practices for programming with data
- useful statistical and mathematical tools
- data cleaning and data analysis tools
- notions of parallel computing for data processing
- data visualization and presentation
- ensuring reproducibility of analyses

The class is conducted in an extremely participatory way, were a lot of training
modules are delivered based on the needs expressed by the students. Some of the
modules delivered last year included Bayesian statistics, code optimization,
introduction to GIS, and how to be less afraid of mathematics. We also watched
the second to last episode of Game of Thrones and managed to not spoil any of
it.

# General informations

## Instructors

The summer school will be led by Timothée Poisot and Andrew MacDonald
(Université de Montréal), and will include guest appearances by local
ecologists. One or two teaching assistants will be here to facilitate the
training.

Timothée is an assistant professor in Quantitative and Computational Ecology. He
is a certified Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructor, serves on the
editorial board of Methods in Ecology & Evolution and PLOS Computational
Biology, and on the scientific board of Calcul Québec. His research focuses on
the spatio-temporal dynamics of species interactions, and the applications of
graph theory to a variety of ecological questions.

Andrew is a postdoctoral researcher at Université de Montreal. He is also a certified
Carpentry instructor, and is passionate about building a community of practice around 
scientific programming in ecology. He's currenlty interested in building predictive 
models for ecological communities.

## Venue

The summer school will take place at the [*Station de Biologie des
Laurentides*][sbl] (SBL), operated by the Université de Montréal. Situated in
the middle of a series of lakes, in the Laurentians, it is a very pleasant and
stimulating place to work and relax. The SBL is also a perfect example of an
emblematic Canadian biome, sitting at the transition zone between the urbanized
Greater Montréal area and the Canadian shield. It is known to have the best food
of all field stations in Canada.

## Dates

The exact dates will be confirmed in the coming weeks; the two possible weeks
are April 27 to May 3, and May 4 to May 10. Selected applicants will be notified
by the second week of February at the latest.

## Transport

We will take care of the transportation from the Université de Montréal to the
field station on the morning on the first day, and from the field station to the
Université de Montréal on the afternoon of the last day. We usually leave at
8am, and return by 4pm. Further details will be given to the selected
applicants.

## Credits

Students from Québec universities can get 4 credits for this class through
CRÉPUQ (class code BIO6065). Please indicate if you want to claim these credits
when applying.

# Program

All days will follow the same template: morning and afternoons are for
practice-based learning, and the evenings are shorter tutorials unless it's dark
enough for a bonfire. We emphasize and value peer instruction; all of the
attendees will bring unique skills and expertise, and it is common that one of
you will take on the role of instructor for a short session.

# Registration

The registration fees are around 300 CAD for UdeM or CRÉPUQ students, and around
750 CAD for other students (these will be fixed shortly). The registration fees
include room and board at the field station, as well as transportation from and
to the university on the first and last days.
